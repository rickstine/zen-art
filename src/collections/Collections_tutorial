What are Collections?
-Collections are like containers that hold multiple objects. Think of them as different types of storage boxes - some are ordered,
some prevent duplicates, some allow quick searching.

The Collections Framework Hierarchy
Collection (Interface)
├── List (Interface)    - Lists store elements in order and allow duplicates.
│   ├── ArrayList  -Best for: Reading data frequently, random access
│   ├── LinkedList -Best for: Frequent insertions/deletions, queue operations
│   └── Vector - Similar to ArrayList but synchronized (thread-safe)
├── Set (Interface)  -Sets store unique elements (no duplicates).
│   ├── HashSet  - Best for: Fast lookups, no specific order needed
│   ├── LinkedHashSet - Maintains insertion order
│   └── TreeSet -  Stores elements in sorted order
└── Queue (Interface)
    ├── LinkedList
    └── PriorityQueue - Elements are ordered by priority

Map (Interface) - Separate hierarchy
├── HashMap
├── LinkedHashMap
└── TreeMap

Common Operations
Most collections support these basic operations:

add() - Add an item
remove() - Remove an item
size() - Get number of items
contains() - Check if item exists
isEmpty() - Check if collection is empty
