Question 1: What is the difference between a class and an object in Java?
Ans : A class can be defined as a blueprint from which you can create an individual object ,class doesn't consume any space.
        Object can be defined as an instance of a class ,an object contains an address and take up some space in memory.

Question 2: What is the difference between the stack and the heap memory in Java?
Ans : Stack memory is the portion of memory that was assigned to every individual program and it is fixed.
        Heap memory is the portion that was not allocated to the java program but it will be available for use by the java program when required
         instantly during the runtime of the program.

Question 3: What is the purpose of the static keyword in Java?
Ans : In Java static keyword is used primarily  to indicate that particular member(method,variable or block) belong to the class itself rather than
        to instance of the class .the main uses of static keyword in java.
        static variable: - shared among all instance of the class.
        static method: - can be called without an instance ,can access  static data.
        static blocks : - initialize static variables when the class is loaded.
        static nested : - can be accessed without an instance of the outer class.

        using the static keyword helps manage memory efficiently and provides utility methods that can be used without creating class instance.

Question 4: What is the difference between String, StringBuilder, and StringBuffer in Java?
Ans: String : immutable cannot be modified once created.
     String Builder : Mutable ,allows Modification of the content not thread safe.
     String Buffer : Similar to String Builder but is thread safe .

Question 5: What are the access modifiers in Java, and what do they mean?
Ans :   Default: Accessible within the same package.
        Private: Accessible only within the declaring class.
        Protected: Accessible in the same package or subclasses in other packages.
        Public: Accessible everywhere.

Question 6: Explain the concept of method overriding in Java.
Ans :  Method Overriding in Java  allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.
       It lets us reuse code from the parent class.
       It lets us change behavior in the child class without changing the parent.
       It supports polymorphism â€” one method, many forms.

Question 7: What are the differences between the final, finally, and finalize keywords in Java?
